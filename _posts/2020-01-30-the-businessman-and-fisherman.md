title: Create a model in Ruby on Rails

To store data in Ruby on Rails you use a model (The M in MVC). Models communicate with the database of the site.

To make a model with the attributes of name and email in the command line type 


```bash
rails generate model User name:string email:string
```
Notice that the `User` model is singular. There are two optional parameters, `name:string` and `email:string`. This tells Rails what attributes you want and the type you want them to to be.

The `generate` command you typed makes a mirgration file inside of the `db/migrate` folder so we can change the data gradually. In this example it made a user table in the database with the columns name and email.

### db/migrate/[timestamp]_create_users.rb

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :email

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

The file that created above inclues a `change` method that decides the changes to the database. The change method uses a Rails method called `create_table` to create a table in the database used for storing users. The `create_table` method accepts a block and the block varible `|t|` which means table.

Inside of the `create_table` method `t` actually creates the name and email columns inside the database with the type of string. The last line in the block is `t.timestamps`, it creates two columns in the database named `created_at` and `updated-at`. The values for these get updated when a user is created and changed.

The `rails generate model User name:string email:string` command also creates the model file as well in `app/models/user.rb` You can see what was created

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
end
```
There isn't much here yet but you don't have any users yet. It does show you `class User < ApplicationRecord` which means in Ruby that the User model has all the operations as `ApplicationRecord`. That topic is outside of the scope of this blog post.

I'll end it here at knowing what happens when a model in created in Rails. Thank you for reading.
