## What is a symbol in Ruby?

The syntax for symbols is a colon then a word `:symbol`

In Ruby on Rails it's common for symbols to be used to identify methods, instance varibles and hash keys

For example 

```ruby
params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password)
```

user is refering to the @user instance variable that get created when you create a new user. The `:name`, `:email`, and `:password` symbols refer to the attributes of the User model.

Instead of accessing using `user["password"]` you can use use `password`to make the syntax cleaner.

Symbols can't be changed what they represent will always be the same. Coming from JavaScript where data can be changed often I like this consistancy in my code.

Also, I found out in my research that since every time you call a symbol is call the same object, so it's only one instance running, but with something like a string the same string will create multiple instances and use more memory.
